# Metal-Surface-Defect-Detection-Using-CNNs-and-Image-Analysis
Metal surface defect detection using CNN and image analysis. Classifies six defect types from grayscale images with 92% accuracy. Includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and performance evaluation. Built with TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib for automated quality inspection.

## Overview

This project automates metal surface defect detection to improve industrial quality inspection. Using grayscale images and a custom CNN (or MobileNetV2), it classifies six common types of surface defects.

---

## Defect Categories

The model can detect the following six types of defects:

- ðŸŸ¤ **Rolled-in Scale (RS)**
- ðŸŸª **Patches (Pa)**
- ðŸ”µ **Crazing (Cr)**
- âš« **Pitted Surface (PS)**
- ðŸŸ¥ **Inclusion (In)**
- âšª **Scratches (Sc)**
